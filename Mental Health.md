# Starting Line's Official Policy on Mental Health

Building a startup is an exhausting process. It is terrifying, stressful, and confusing. It can also be exhilarating. The highs are higher than any other feeling; the lows depress similarly. As a founder remarked to us recently, “my mood is dictated daily by the performance of our Shopify revenue.”

If not managed and balanced, these volatile emotions can become unhealthy. Worse, they can affect performance.

We would know: we raised Starting Line against long odds, in a tough fundraising environment, while taking no paychecks.

That’s why we’re releasing our formal policy in support of mental health. It is our hope and expectation that all founders (in Starting Line’s portfolio and beyond) are in a consistent habit of meeting with a mental health professional. 

To that end, we are offering the following subsidies to founders in Starting Line's portfolio:

* Starting Line will subsidize each founder’s first three sessions of therapy, executive coaching, or co-founder counseling (up to $200 each.)
* Starting Line will provide a $750 subsidy for each portfolio company to organize and host an executive coach or therapist to work with their founding team on communication, empathy, or another topic that advances the cohesion of the founding team. 

To facilitate founder therapy, we assist in the following ways:
1. We request the state/location where the founder is requesting therapy.
2. We help source therapists or coaches who are local and specialize in working with entrepreneurs in high stress/high anxiety settings.
3. We provide a list of suggestions and contact information. It is the founders responsibility to engage with therapist and begin the relationship.

The goals here are straightforward – first, to reduce the friction and barriers towards engaging on this important issue. And secondly, to provide an incentive towards longer term care and health. Through our networks, we are happy to anonymously assist any founder who is interested in therapy, executive coaching, or co-founder counseling, but doesn’t know where to start.

In addition, we will provide all founders, upon their request, and at no expense, with the following list of books (a library which we hope will grow over time):

* [Dare to Lead](https://www.amazon.com/Dare-Lead-Brave-Conversations-Hearts/dp/0399592520) by Brene Brown
* [Insight](https://www.amazon.com/Insight-Surprising-Others-Ourselves-Answers-ebook/dp/B01JWDWP4Y
) by Tasha Eurich
* [Essentialism](https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown-ebook/dp/B00G1J1D28/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YKAO0CBCFJYN&keywords=essentialism&qid=1552874306&s=digital-text&sprefix=essentialism%2Cdigital-text%2C364&sr=1-1
) by Greg Mckeown

It is our sincere hope that this is only a first step in a larger dialogue – and that as our assets under management grow over time, we will be able to increase the subsidies we offer to all founders.
