# LP Quarterly Letters

We are trying something different here, publishing the letters we send to our LPs each quarter.

Each quarter, we circulate a variety of updates and thoughts to our fund's investors. We break them down into three sections:
1. The Front Line
2. The Portfolio
3. The Finish Line

Because it would be inappropriate to share the specific performance updates of Starting Line's portfolio, we are only publishing the first section, "The Front Line." Our hope is that it provides some additional insight into the trends we're following and how we think:

* [Q4 2022](https://github.com/startinglinevc/Overview/blob/master/Quarterly%20Letters.md#q4-2022)
* [Q3 2022](https://github.com/startinglinevc/Overview/blob/master/Quarterly%20Letters.md#q3-2022)
* [Q2 2022](https://github.com/startinglinevc/Overview/blob/master/Quarterly%20Letters.md#q2-2022)

## Q4 2022

**On Growth vs Profitability**

Something that is generally easy to do and generally low career risk is to embrace learned observations once they have become fairly obvious, for example suggesting in December 2022 “that the market currently prioritizes profitability over growth!” You are correct and everyone nods their heads in agreement!

Something that is slightly harder to do is to articulate why the market now prioritizes profitability over growth. One answer that is unequivocally true although somewhat unsatisfying is that interest rates went up quickly due to aggressive fed policy. This is known to be true because the correlation between the historic October 2021 CPI print and the peak valuation of growth stocks is pretty darn near 100%. It is also known to be true because of the concept of the time value of money and that a higher Fed Funds rate today makes the incremental dollar ten years from now less valuable. Still, it is an unsatisfying answer because those are exogenous events and not intrinsic to either profitability nor growth.

Something I would like to attempt is to compartmentalize the implications underpinning the mantras of profitability versus growth. In my opinion, it goes something like this:

According to modern monetary theory, lower interest rates are a lever to stimulate economic activity. The less it costs to borrow money, the more investment risk individuals and businesses are willing to assume in order to expand. The implication therefore of lower rates – is that we are currently in, or will soon enter into, a period of market expansion. 

Market expansion is an interesting concept. If we believe that markets are growing or will grow in the near term, we are incentivized to make decisions and take risks to capture an outsized share of this potential value creation. In a period of market expansion, one of the worst strategic outcomes is to allow market share to accrue to a competitor. This is because in the long run, it should be easier to acquire new customers who are non-consumers rather than intercept and re-orient customers later. As Clayton Christen opines, targeting non-consumption is “the most viable path to growth.” If market rates are telling us that we are in a period of non-consumption coming online, we should spend (arguably unprofitably) to capture it today and harvest it later.

During these expansionary moments, the market correctly prioritizes companies that apply an aggressive growth mindset because they are more likely to accrue an outsized percentage of new market share.

A lower rate environment implies that we have, or will soon, exit the expansionary period. Accordingly, if new customers are less available because markets are contracting or even just stagnant, investing aggressively into courting them will be a poor strategic decision in most cases. The market therefore penalizes businesses that ignore this shift and are making poor economic decisions. 

This would suggest that it’s not that profitability is better or growth is better – it’s all a function of appropriate business strategy dependent on new customer availability. This is why at Starting Line we take a company by company approach on our guidance of how to maneuver the current market. It would be inappropriate to suggest that all companies should cut burn and work towards breakeven. For our portfolio companies in nascent categories with strong product/market pull and with clear signs that the category continues to expand around them, we are encouraging them to prioritize capturing share. For our invetments in contracting categories, for example those dependent on consumer discretionary spend, it makes sense for them to re-prioritize runway and profitability. It is all a function of customer capture.  

One final note. In our Q2 2018 quarterly memo, I shared an essay entitled “Consolidator vs Consolidatee.” In it, I outlined the following:

>"In many venture scale categories from fashion to fintech to food, the ability to raise upstream capital is materially contingent upon whether a company is perceived as likely to be the dominant brand and acquirer in their space – even if the current product or customer base are sub-scale. Why is this important? Because in today’s early stage venture markets, which feature an abundance of capital and relatively low barriers to launch products, every good idea or macro change inspires a dozen startups that are roughly similar. Therefore, each investment must pass an additional hurdle: can this Company achieve enough scale in a short period of time to become a consolidator?"

This concept is an intriguing evolution in early stage investing in that it reorients much of what I observed in the mid 2010s. Of course every investor has always desired large outcomes, but during those years, investment mandates tended to be increasingly focused on metrics, cohort analyses, payback periods, etc. It’s not that granular numbers don’t matter – they should and do – but it appears that early stage investing is also reverting back to its fundamentals: does this management team have the acumen and experience to hire 100s of individuals and make multiple acquisitions in a short period of time AND is the category predisposed to enable strong velocity.
It is for these reasons that every investment opportunity must be viewed through the lens of: how likely is it that this company and this management team will become a consolidator in their category. Companies with good metrics but facing headwinds from competitors with bigger balance sheets and better product teams will be unlikely to find the financing to survive. Big outcomes, those that generate a 10x+ return to LPs, are increasingly unlikely to come from “good businesses;” they are far more likely to come from category consolidators.

It is unclear to us how the “consolidator” approach to venture capital plays out over the coming months and years. Venture investors – including us – are still heavily biased towards founders that are capable of quickly deploying large sums of capital towards building category killers. At the same time, we are seeing many of these pedigreed founders struggle to defend their vision of capital consumption when juxtaposed with upside down unit economics. Our belief is that over the past many years, “consolidators” were defined by a company’s balance sheet, not the underlying business nor its momentum in the category – a trend we continue to watch closely. 

**The Ultimate Grift and the Perils of Trust**

In early 2013, I sent an email that would forever change my life:

 

I had stumbled across Nick’s blog after he visited my Linkedin profile. At the time, I was a second year MBA student at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I had a prestigious VC job lined up post graduation. I was a new father. Life was good!

But Nick’s blog had opened a pandoras box for me. Among other things, he had written analytically about bitcoin. I had used bitcoin to deposit money in order to play online poker as early as 2012 but never considered it an investable asset. Nick liked my blog as well and we became friends. Unsurprisingly, I soon became obsessed with bitcoin. And Mastercoin. And peercoin. And counterparty. I cashed out the Johnson and Johnson shares my grandparents had gifted me at some point and put 100% of it into crypto. 

When my full time VC role began, I met with founders with about 80% of my time. And I was presumably respectable at my job. But the remaining 20% was focused on learning crypto. I taught myself how to mine. I began posting on Bitcointalk, attending meetups, even becoming a Casascius enthusiast. When Mt Gox imploded in 2014, it was very clear to me that the warning signs mirrored the insolvencies I’d witnessed in the online poker industry. And furthermore, that the blockchain could’ve avoided the debacle given the real time visibility into wallets – de facto proof of reserves. So I wrote an Oped for the Wall St Journal on the subject.

I kept studying the technology. I invested in the first ever crypto hedge fund (it ultimately also misappropriated investor funds!) I spoke at crypto conferences. Miraculously, crypto proceeds would ultimately provide the funds I needed to launch Starting Line.

My old friend Nick had done pretty well for himself in the meantime. Obsessed with crypto, he dropped out of Yale School of Management after a semester, joined Coinbase as one of their first employees. Two years later, he would spin out on his own to launch 1Confirmation, an early crypto fund and one of the best performing pooled funds in history. Thankfully, we’re still friends.

Which brings me to this exchange with Nick from six months ago:

 

It was, in fact, obvious in time. 98 days to be exact. The FTX inferno reminded me of the words I had written to each and every one of you on October 4th:

It wasn’t the first time I found myself swept up in an industry awash with overnight wealth creation and easy riches. As a Sophomore in college, I was in the early wave of teens and twenty somethings who found online poker, studied game theory, and quickly realized its earning potential far outpaced that of lawyers, doctors or surgeons. In 2012, I discovered bitcoin, taught myself how to mine, and watched intently as internet anons from Bitcointalk forums transitioned from anarchists to millionaires in an eight week period in late 2013. I reflect on these experiences and more in an old 2017 blog post, On Being Early and Being Right. 

In both of those experiences, as well as 2021’s unicorn bubble, I watched as the industries I loved were overrun with naïve enthusiasts, opportunistic tourists, and grifters. And as each of those three manias evolved, I exhibited nearly identical behavior: initially avoiding most new entrants who I (often, incorrectly) assumed had only joined for the quick riches, thereafter capitulating slightly into the mania by aligning on occasion and experimentally with people whom I did not fully trust but had been deemed “thought leaders,” while ultimately reverting to my existing, trusted network and observing at a distance as the party carried on without me. In each of these instances, my conservative behavior undoubtedly left some upside on the table – but also smoothed out the volatility of my returns while avoiding outright frauds and cons.

One of the reasons I personally had minimal exposure to the FTX ecosystem and why Starting Line generally avoided Sam’s circle of influence is due to friends I trust cautioning us accordingly. As evidenced above, I generally thought he was affable and harmless. And I was wrong. But I didn’t risk much in his products because the people I trusted most saw red flags. 

At Starting Line, we’ll gladly admit that we are unlikely to be the smartest minds in the room (in fact, as a general rule, we want to invest in founders far smarter than us.) But we are aligned on our collective superpower: cleaving to inherently interesting, intellectually curious, risk taking people, who are fundamentally trustworthy. This can take time. Decades. But the long game will always be worth it.

One example: in 2015 my dear friend Taylor approached with a crazy idea for an on demand app that would allow anyone to see celebrity locations in real time and book a “meetup” with them in order to take a selfie. Selfies, he related to me, had eclipsed autographs in importance to millennials and GenZ. While I found the concepts intellectually stimulating, I told him the idea wouldn’t work because only one city in the world had enough density of celebrities to actually execute matches with any consistency. Twelve months later I would meet Cameo. We are all a byproduct of our networks. And high integrity friends make us 10x better.

There will always be a new frontier and new frontiers will always be vectors for fraud. In 2010, when Full Tilt Poker misappropriated customer funds, it was online poker. In 2018 and 2019, with Theranos and Outcome Health, it was healthtech. In 2022, it’s crypto. In 2024, it will be something else. Wherever it is, we are likely to be there. And we are likely to get some right and get some wrong.

Our continued edge as a firm is that as technology and markets inevitably evolve, we have accumulated a network of intellectually curious thinkers – of the utmost integrity – who will help guide us towards similar founders and thinkers who share our values and our mission. 

Everyone on team Starting Line will relate that we spend more time on personal references than any other form of diligence. Our personal diligence goes beyond inquiring about strengths and weaknesses. We demand an understanding of the journey, the incentives and the motivations for a set of entrepreneurs to find themselves on the starting line of a new company. Each startup backstory and founding team is a puzzle and one of our jobs as managers is to ensure that the puzzle is congruous and fits together. 

This approach means we will almost certainly sacrifice upside when dynamic, talented tourists enter the market. And we are comfortable with that. We are here to invest. We want no part of the grift. 

## Q3 2022

**DEFINING PRODUCT MARKET FIT**

In this quarter’s memo we are sharing two present day investment theses around Cameo (Fund I) and Go (Fund II), both of which we have updated this past month. To summarize our jobs as venture investors, it would be to invest in businesses that provide radically superior customer experiences to the status quo, and achieve that superiority through a technical, business model or network effect innovation.

Investing in businesses that offer transformative consumer experiences is in many ways easier in the public markets and growth stages than the early stage private markets. In the public markets, the consumer experiences are generally observable and known. Those businesses then trade – not on their value propositions – but rather on a myriad of viewpoints relating to their underlying business model, their defensibility, and their solvency, all of which serve as inputs, broadly, for a terminal value analysis.

Early stage private markets are, in my opinion, more complex. Not only are many of the business model inputs largely unproven, the proposed new value propositions are themselves often unproven! At our General Meeting and in our Q2 investor calls, we began reporting on Product Market Fit across our portfolio. Feedback on that metric questioned the heuristics we use to define product market fit. We hope these deeper dives will begin to unpack that thought process.

The entirety of these investment theses can be reviewed by clicking the Google Doc links below. These links will remain active through October 14th and thereafter only available via request. As these memos include confidential information, we ask that they not be shared.

**The Case for Cameo**

Cameo offers a radically new customer experience, pioneering the ability for any consumer or business to book celebrities for messages, greetings, endorsements, or customer engagements. This is a dramatic 10-100x improvement over the status quo. For consumers, who historically would have zero direct access to their favorite talent. And for businesses, who historically would have to contract either traditional Hollywood agencies, the incumbent Speakers Bureaus, or pursue direct relationships. For businesses, the Cameo marketplace has also provided price discovery to a historically opaque process while also driving down the cost to hire talent for endorsements given they can fulfill the request at home, through their phones.

**The Case for Go**  

Go offers a radically superior customer experience, allowing any prospective car leaser to procure a new car from their phone or laptop, complete a checkout in under 10 minutes, and have the car delivered to their home within a week. In addition to the radically superior experience versus waiting and negotiating at a traditional dealership, Go is also able to deliver their cars to the customer for 15-25% cheaper monthly “lease” rates than traditional dealerships while requesting zero money down. In theory, unless a customer demanded a test drive, there would be zero incentive to transact via a traditional dealership as opposed to Go. Further, as described below, we believe Go has a series of compounding advantages that increase its network value and economics at scale.

## Q2 2022

**GENERAL MEETING RECAP**

Over the course of our general meeting, we covered strategic deep dives into current market conditions, the strategies we underwrote when launching Starting Line, certain market changes that have forced us to adapt, as well as our action items and perceived edge moving into the next evolution of the market. We also analyzed Fund I and Fund II performance in detail.

Although it is impossible to share the totality of those conversations in this memo, we have highlighted seven slides below with associated commentary:

**THE RISK/STAGE CONTINUUM:** 

Image Redcated
 
Commentary: Many of you have inquired over the years whether valuations “outside the coasts” are more reasonable. My answer has remained consistent: that perhaps there is more “value” investing in non venture scale companies than in traditional venture markets, but that valuations for a venture scale $3M seed round tend to be in line with comparable coastal seed rounds.

One nuanced difference between the two, however, is the margin of error of stage, in terms of provable product/market fit. While very few seed stage companies anywhere have demonstrable product/market fit, Chicago based seed stage companies – by virtue of tighter angel markets and fewer pre-seed funds – tend to bootstrap for several months at the outset, or otherwise drive efficiency in a cash constrained environment. This is in contradistinction to coastal markets where thriving angel ecosystems and cash rich technology workers have been willing to underwrite pre-launch risk for budding startups. 

As the Covid boom proliferated and the entire economy became risk-on, this geographic “margin of error” – the opportunity to underwrite “seed” deals with real suggestions of product/market fit – quickly deteriorated. We discussed this at length in our 2021 Q4 memo, under the heading “The Risk/Stage Continuum.” Per the above graphs, our Fund II, launched in November 2020, shows a significant increase in overall riskiness. The number of dollars we invested into pre-launch businesses grew by 70%, and the number of dollars we deployed into true product/market fit halved, with valuations remaining at parity, or, in some cases, increasing. 

Because the entire venture ecosystem has cooled over the past six months, we are hopeful that this graph will normalize towards Fund I risk allocation levels as we deploy the remaining 30-40% of our second fund into a less frothy fundraising environment.

**GEOGRAPHIC ARBITRAGE:**

Image Redacted
 
Commentary: Although we are proud to have led investments in many of Chicago’s leading startups, we have historically eschewed both any branding as a “geo focused” venture capital firm, as well as the hypothesis that a geographically constrained investment mandate could produce top 5% returns.

In theory, over the long run, I continue to believe both of those hesitancies to be accurate. But in the near term, and over the past several years, we have demonstrated material edge on a geographically denominated basis.

Our two top performing investments from Fund I, Cameo and Klover, are both headquartered in Chicago. Our two top performing investments from Fund II (from a fundraising/valuation perspective), Stacked and Protégé, are also both headquartered in Chicago. In both funds, Chicago headquartered investments represent approximately 25% of total investments. In fact, all six of the “unicorns” that I, Ezra, have sourced in my venture career – Cameo, M1Finance, Kin, Flyhomes, Hungryroot and Sunbit – have all either been headquartered in Chicago, emerged from Chicago based universities, or otherwise had deep Chicago roots.

We do not desire to be a “Chicago fund” and we do expect that our early successes will continue to accelerate a flywheel of strong dealflow nationally. Nevertheless, the data paints a compelling story. In addition, the recent growth of an unprecedented number of unicorns locally in Chicago, coupled with our clear data and networks advantage, do lead us to believe that in the near term a large number of ambitious, experienced executives will emerge from these growth stage companies to found new, compelling ideas. We believe that our Chicago based deal volume should increase 50-100% from 4-5 deals per fund towards 6-10.

**BETTING ON NICHE MARKETS:**

Image Redcated
 
Commentary: One of our core operating philosophies has been a willingness to invest in markets perceived as “too small” or “too nascent” by other investors. Our experience as investors and operators has taught us that the intersection of great founders, great products, and behavioral change can quickly expand emerging markets beyond their expected opportunity size.

The slide above represents our efforts and associated successes (blue circles) and failures (orange circles) of investing in niche, or “emerging” categories in Fund I. On the bottom line, the blue arrows represent minted unicorns or clearly category winners, with the red circles representing the startups whom we also spoke to, but ultimately chose a different market player. 

For example, in the “creator economy,” a category that did not exist in 2016, we picked one of the clear 2-3 winners in Cameo. So too in mobile lending. Where we initially invested in Klover, the category was dramatically similar, with both Brigit and Dave only at Series A stage. At this point, we are confident Klover will be one of the 2-3 category winners. 

When we invested in Unchained Capital in 2018, centralized crypto lenders had lent no more than $25M in aggregate across all known players – Unchained, BlockFi and Salt. We spoke to all the players, and co-led a seed round in Unchained, ultimately believing they had the strongest technology and the deepest moats. In retrospect, we were correct that the category mattered: BlockFi, Celcius, Voyager, Nexo, and more all became (or, perhaps, more correctly “had become” until their recent liquidity struggles) multi-billion dollar winners. While we are confident that Unchained will be a “successful” investment, in retrospect we likely did not select the highest multiple opportunity. In other categories such as digital extended warranties – a category that functionally did not exist when we invested in Clyde – it is far too early to tell how it all plays out, though we recognize Clyde is a #2 player to Extend.

Net, we believe we have shown good judgment in selecting emerging categories that produce big outcomes and matter. We are high conviction that if we continue to pick high tailwind categories, we will ultimately align with some fair number of market winners. While Fund II is far too early to apply a similar analysis, we have invested in the following categories that are today small, but we believe can expand quickly:

•	NCAA Name, Image and Likeness (NIL)
•	Online Car Leases
•	Interactive TVs
•	Rental Credit Reporting
•	Textile Recyling
•	Peer to Peer Laundry
•	Managed Crypto Advisory


**DISCOUNTING FUND I:**

Image Redacted
 
Commentary: Despite the best of our intentions, there is no perfect methodology for accurately evaluating the value of our current portfolio given the pull back in revenue and EBITDA multiples across the technology industry.

One approach we took, to provide a realistic and, ideally, overly conservative framework was to assess our portfolio companies against public market comps on an EV/Sales basis, then extrapolate out the enterprise value based on those public comps, and discount the value of our own holdings on that basis. Of course, this is an imperfect analysis as EV/Sales is only one variable. The public comps are imperfect. In all cases, our portfolio companies are growing faster than the public comps, and, in some cases, the public comps actually have negative growth. Many of our portfolio companies also hold material strategic value for a myriad host of potential acquirers which would inflect valuation higher. Nevertheless, the above slide is A framework – not the only one and dates to late May.

For Fund I, there are really only six companies to date with sufficient revenues to fit into this analysis. These values, based on public equity multiples dating to late May suggest that our “mark to market” is directionally correct for Made In and Klover, but substantially off for the remainder. The biggest dislocations are for Cameo and Unchained, which is to be expected as multiples for both digital marketplaces (Etsy, Fiverr, Upwork, etc) and crypto companies have retraced dramatically. In aggregate, this approach would suggest our gross portfolio value on a “last round” basis, is overvalued by roughly 45%.



**THE DILUTION BUBBLE:**

Image Redacted

       
Commentary: There has been a lot of opinionated commentary on the valuation bloat in venture capital and the expected reversion over the coming months. In our opinion, that focus, while true, buries the lede.

Private market valuations are unrealized, and therefore, absent excess demand in the form of secondary buyers, are merely an interim guide or proxy for ultimate outcome values. Dilution, however, is both a tangible and realized input, with a massive impact on ultimate distributions and multiples.

Over the past several years, as valuations have bloated, firms such as Starting Line have been a major beneficiary of reduced overall dilution. As you can see in the above slide, the net dilution we’ve assumed across 3-4 funding rounds for many of our top Fund I companies, inclusive of options pool expansions is 30-45%. This is substantially less than the historical norm and allows us to maintain a large ownership stake over time while maintaining a fund strategy of holding only 25-35% of committed capital in reserves.

If, as expected, valuations soften over the coming months and “flat round is the new up round,” we would expect our net dilution for the same stages to increase by 20-40%, especially if upstream investors demand larger employee options pools. This would have a negative impact on absolute fund multiple and has already forced to begin re-evaluating our reserves strategy.




**FUND II PERFORMANCE TRENDLINE:**

Image Redcated
 
Commentary: Fund II, formally a November 2020 vintage, remains extremely nascent overall, with $17M of capital deployed to date, more than half of that in the past 12 months. We have between 7-9 core investments remaining from this fund. Four companies have raised incremental funding: Spot (led by Kleiner Perkins), Stacked (led by FTX/Alameda), Protégé (led by Sequoia), and Umamicart (led by insiders M13 and FJ Labs.)

While fund performance should always be evaluated on an underlying business basis rather than a markup basis, that is often not the case as the former is complex while the latter is far more approachable. 

But we thought it was important to share the progress across seven Fund II investments, all of whom have generated impressive revenue progress since our initial investment, even while not formally appreciating in “market” value.






**CONCENTRATION IS CORRELATION:**

Image Redacted
 
Commentary: In late April, Cendana Capital, a leading Fund of Funds for early stage venture capital firms, published proprietary research suggesting that their best performing funds all over-indexed on a company ownership and concentration basis.

Specifically, their analysis suggested that their best performing Seed funds had a 10:1 concentration ratio, while their Pre-Seed funds held a 5:1 concentration rate. For example, a $100M Seed fund, would need to own on average 10% of each company, at initial investment, to likely outperform. Similarly, a $100M Pre-Seed fund would need to own 20% on average, presumably due to a higher loss ratio, and additional dilution over time from investing one round earlier.

Starting Line Fund II is a $30M vehicle, generally straddling the line between Pre-Seed and Seed. Accordingly, if we were a Seed fund, we would need to maintain 3% average ownership across first checks to viably outperform; 6% if we were a Pre-Seed fund. Realistically, we are somewhere in between.

The slide above represents the Seed mandate on the blue line, with the grey line representing Pre-Seed thresholds. The blue line is representative of our average ownership allocations across our first 14 core (non scout) investments. Overall, we are pleased to be outperforming on this metric thus far in our second fund.


## Q1 2022

**Brian Chesky and a Semester Abroad**

Something I have probably not shared in these memos is that I have odd hobbies, and one of the hobbies that I greatly enjoy doing in my spare time is reading transcripts of public company conference calls (I don’t have the patience to listen in real time). I don’t know why I particularly enjoy this exercise but I tend to do a lot of it on airplanes. My wife would much prefer I watch The Bachelor with her, her logic being I will learn more about human behavior and pop culture than I do from a call transcript, and, I do admit, she is probably correct. Nevertheless, I prefer conference calls.

It has been interesting to track the Covid era IPO class, which as we all know, has not fared particularly well, with special demerits granted for being a technology company. Of the handful of exceptions, Airbnb has been particularly impressive – opening trading more than 2x above IPO pricing, and compounding gains since, with the stock price up 10%+ YTD in 2022.

It is therefore not entirely surprising that one of the best conference calls I have ever encountered was Airbnb’s most recent EOY conference call. First, because CEO Brian Chesky presented the most comprehensive and thoughtful approach to expanding the supply side of his marketplace (and, consequently, expanding the total addressable market size) that I have ever heard, and second, because Chesky hosted a clinic on how to think through corporate marketing in a manner far more advanced than most startups we work with.

First, on expanding supply:

>"Stephen Ju Okay. So, Brian, I think you rightly called out the longer-term stays as your fastest-growing category, and you’re going to be in the roster as well. So, thinking about the other side of the equation and I guess, the supply side of the equation. So, how are your hosts responding to the rise in this type of demand? And are there any sort of supply and demand imbalance considerations we should be thinking about or worrying about? Because it seems like the pandemic has definitely taught the consumer that they can work and stay anywhere. Thanks.  

>"Brian Chesky Hey Stephen. This is a really, really great question. And you are correct that there -- that -- just let me preface our supply question by saying that there’s this entire acceleration in this new category of travel, which is that people are less tethered to an office, so they can now live anywhere, not everyone but a lot of people…Now, because of that, we need to make sure we have enough supply. So, let’s talk about how we get that… The number one source of host on Airbnb are prior guests. In fact, in Q4, 33% of hosts were prior guests, and that number has been going up over the last couple of years. And we think the reason why is most of our community are regular everyday people. They’re teachers, they’re health care workers, they’re students and really everyday people. And as they make money and they get a lot of bookings, we think what’s happening is they’re telling their friends in their neighborhood and community, and they are also listing, and then some other people are expanding their business. So that’s the first thing is our global network. 

>"Next, we have a full funnel approach to recruiting hosts. First, Stephen, we need to make sure that more people know about hosting. We want the brand of hosting to be as mainstream as the brand of Airbnb, which is a noun, a verb used all over the world. So, we did two major host brand campaigns last year: Made Possible by Hosting and a Stranger campaign, and both campaigns have driven a lot more traffic and a lot prospective people to Airbnb. 

>"Next, we want to make sure it’s easier to become a host. So, what we did last year is we reduced the number of steps down to 10 easy steps to become a host. One of the things we’ve learned over the course of starting Airbnb and growing Airbnb is the number of -- the less friction, the better the conversion funnel. And so, as we make something easier, more people do it. And we also know that hosting is something that makes people ask questions about. And so, what we wanted to do is match our very best prospective host with their very best Superhost, so they can ask questions and get their questions answered. And this has led to a higher conversion rate of people becoming host. 

>"And then finally, we wanted to start addressing the obstacles that people [have to] hosting. Now, one of the most common obstacles we heard are people were nervous about their home being damaged when they rented out to guests. And so, we launched last year with AirCover, top-to-bottom protection, free for every host only in our Airbnb, and this included $1 million damage protection and liability insurance. 

>"[Last] because more people are flexible about where and when they’re traveling, it means we’re further up funnel. 800 million searches have used I’m Flexible. And this means that we can start to point demand where we have supply because we are not supply constrained globally on any night of the year. The challenge is just that too many people go to too few places at the same time. But as the world gets more flexible, we can balance supply-demand in addition to our other strategies. So that’s the answer, global network, a full host recruitment strategy and pointing demand to where we have supply.

If you are an LP in Starting Line and work in most non technology industries, perhaps real estate or possibly consulting, this response probably seems astute and generally thoughtful but not particularly groundbreaking. If, however, you spend your life studying high growth startups, it is fundamental.

Part of what makes venture capital fun is fast growth and high multiples. Founders are perceived to have generated tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of enterprise value overnight and employees share in both the economic reward and the adrenaline rush of the growth momentum. The challenging aspect of our jobs is how leadership, employees and investors react once growth begins to slow.

Growth slowing can be a function of a few factors. Management/employees can feel they’ve worked hard and accomplished a lot, and begin working somewhat less hard. Customers can be harder to prospect and find than in the early days when there was ample underserved demand. A Company can experience inventory/supply shortages as they grow – often in markets which had never anticipated so much demand. And last, perhaps a combination of the prior two points, a startup can push the boundaries of its natural market size. (Uber’s slide deck famously advertised a taxi industry total market size of $4.2B; the company generated $26B in bookings in 2021.)

The best consumer internet businesses tend to find constraints in that final bucket – testing the limits of their underlying market size. And the best consumer businesses will actively experience market size constraints several times over the course of their company journeys. Exceptional companies must spend a lot of time thinking through how to grow their addressable market. What makes Chesky’s response so remarkable is the clarity of framework in reducing these constraints, re-expanding the market size, and priming the Company for future growth.

Later, on marketing: 

>"We have a pretty different marketing approach than our competitors because we take a full-funnel approach to marketing. And it combines PR with brand marketing and performance marketing, and PR is actually probably the most important channel to build the brand of Airbnb. And that is because Airbnb has got an offering that's really unique. And so, because of that, people are deeply passionate about, they tell one another, and every Airbnb's become a noun and a verb used all over the world.

>"We got more than half a million articles on Airbnb just last year alone. So, it's been a very important part of our marketing strategy. And I think this explains why nearly 90% of our traffic remains direct or on pace. Now, we take brand marketing, we think of as really investment in educating the world about Airbnb.

>"So, it's not really about buying customers but educating people what makes Airbnb special. And then we think of performance marketing as really a laser, to laser in on balancing supply and demand…

>"Number one, yes, we think the area that needs a little more investment is the brand of hosting. The brand of Airbnb is noun and verb used all over the world. And very few people at this point who travel regularly and book travel on Internet don't know about Airbnb. But we don't think enough people know about the incredible economic benefits to hosting and just be incredible, like what it brings to people's lives to be able to bring the world to their home.

>"… Again, we think of marketing as education, education, and what we have that's unique and different, and we're going to educate the world about hosting, and we're going to educate the world about our new products and innovations this year.

 

Chesky has one core insight on his business and he emphasizes it repeatedly: that Airbnb is an exceptional product, offering unique experiences, and he is darn proud of how special it is. To continue to grow, it is incumbent on him to focus less on selling his product and more on educating prospective buyers on what Airbnb can do for them. This is not necessarily an emotional appeal – but rather a combination of utility and novelty. 

This is a key lesson that most startups tend to forget. Many founders we’ve backed are natural salespeople – that tends to correlate well with building a B2C startup. Yet this sales obsession tends to be the only heuristic in too many marketing organizations, with many growth leaders at our portfolio companies singularly focused on LTV:CAC ration (Life Time Value : Customer Acquisition Cost.) In many marketing conversations it feels as if the customer has been dehumanized – reduced to a series of psychographic inputs on a spectrum of look-a-like audience targeting. 

Of course, direct response marketing is important, as Chesky notes. But the lesson is that marketing must start holistically. Any Company we’ve invested in to date has been a function of having conviction that the founders are remarkable and the products they’re building are incredible. The underlying opportunity is around communicating how special these products are – not merely trying to sell them.

The second lesson from Chesky’s response is around the importance of organic growth, word of mouth and viral PR, per Gurley’s tweet. Although this is not a new insight from him, and is synergistic with the educational marketing approach above, it remains underreported overall and under-emphasized in nearly all of our portfolio companies. 




## Q1 2021

**On Hype Cycles**

The best interview I listened to this past quarter was between Jordan Fish (pictured to the left, below), better known by his online handle “CryptoCobain” and Su Zhu  (pictured right), the CEO and Founding Partner of Three Arrows Capital, a leading cryptocurrency investment firm. While Su has a more traditional background than Jordan, both are largely self-made through the cryptocurrency arena, with Jordan, specifically, having reportedly traded a single $100 deposit into over $250M of profits since 2013.

My favorite moment came about fifteen minutes in, with Su offering the following analysis:

>“In general with hype cycles, the hype is usually correct, it’s just early. I think that’s almost always been true in technology, it has always been true in markets. Very rarely do people get very hyped about something and then it’s not actually that good of an idea"

This, of course, is a more refined synthesis of the famous Gartner Hype Cycle analysis for Emerging Technologies:

An understanding of hype cycles has perhaps never been more relevant than the past quarter where emerging asset classes, ranging from software startups to cryptocurrencies to digital basketball cards (Topshot) to cryptopunks (NFTs) to meme stonks have all seen surging valuations and hype. The following tweet gave me a pretty hearty chuckle: 

One of the blessings of a ten year venture capital fund cycle, is that we have a broad margin of error when investing through hype cycles. Ideally, you back an emerging trend ahead of a hype cycle – such as our investment in Cameo, before the “creator economy” was even a coined phrase. But as these cycles increasingly speed up – and, accordingly go from peak to trough to peak in 2-4 years – it is acceptable for us to invest even at later points in the curve. An example of this would be our June 2018 investment in Unchained Capital, nearly buying the peak of the last bitcoin cycle, but which has nevertheless grown approximately 40x since then. The learnings from that investment are twofold: (a) invest in founders who are missionaries, not mercenaries, meaning they deeply care about the category they are building into, not simply hoping to profit off it and (b) invest in founders who are capable and enthusiastic fundraisers, as they will almost certainly need to source incremental capital to ensure solvency during periods of lower category interest.

As it relates to today, we are spending a lot of time thinking about how to build category exposure to NFTs, collectibles, and the growing populist trend within broader equity markets. All of these are now on the radar emerging markets, many with ample publicity. But we are confident that by identifying and backing the right founding teams, even though these markets are somewhat less nascent, we will be materially rewarded over the course of this fund cycle. 

**The Next Consumer Bet: Mass Inflation**

Over the past twelve months, everyone became armchair epidemiologists. Over the next twelve months, they will magically transform into macroeconomists.

I have written before that our job as venture capital investors is not to predict the future, but rather to be astutely cognizant of the present. While there are many identifiable catalysts for near term behavioral change – such as vaccinations and hybrid work environments – it seems to us that the greatest under-appreciated near term catalyst for mass behavioral change is another decade of great inflation.

In our Q2 2020 memo, in a piece entitled “Money Printer Go Brrrrr,” we shared the following:
The reason – as we know – that economic carnage wasn’t so bad is that the Federal Reserve printed many trillions of dollars and doled them out to corporations and taxpayers alike. Here’s what the impact looks like (10 yr chart) from an M1 & M2 money supply perspective: 
   
But wait, there’s more! In a March 22nd interview on 60 Minutes, Neel Kashkari, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in response to interviewer Scott Pelly’s question of “can you characterize everything the Fed has done this past week as essentially flooding the system with money?” responded: “Yes. Exactly. And there is no end to our ability to do that.” 

Neel, rather unsurprisingly, given his role and title, turned out to be correct. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve printed a fresh $1.9T of cash, backed solely by the trust and faith in the United States government. Given the relative nascence of modern monetary theory, no one actually knows what will happen when you infuse a local economic system with $5-8T of capital, roughly 50% of all money in circulation. But you’d be ignorant to assume there won’t be any consequences.

The interesting thing about the possibility of great inflation is how unaware the general public appears to be of it actually manifesting. In fact, in this Radiolab podcast from January 2021, recorded by NPR/New York Public Radio, and entitled More Money, Less Problems, the host attempt to argue that inflation is mostly a behavioral construct and, should we choose to, we can simply will it away:
> JACOB GOLDSTEIN: Yes. What people expect about inflation actually affects whether there is inflation and how much.
> JAD ABUMRAD: Wait. I'm sorry. You're saying if I think there's going to be inflation, that somehow manifests inflation into existence?
> BECCA BRESSLER: Yes.
> JACOB GOLDSTEIN: Exactly right, exactly right.
> BECCA BRESSLER: So expecting inflation can literally cause it. But because inflation has been absent for so long...
> JACOB GOLDSTEIN: We just live in a world where we expect that prices aren't going to go up very much.
> BECCA BRESSLER: And so that expectation...
> JACOB GOLDSTEIN: It effectively keeps inflation low.
> BECCA BRESSLER: Oh, my God. So it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
> JACOB GOLDSTEIN: It's - it is absolutely a self-fulfilling prophecy.

More articles worth reading include “Asset Price Inflation” is not a thing, wherein Matt Ygelias argues that asset prices fundamentally do not define inflation and subtly opines one of my favorite concepts of the past quarter: “weird stuff happens in good times.” I’ve also been learning Capitalism in America by Alan Greeenspan and Adrian Woolridge, who spend a couple chapters on the history of Stagflation. But in truth, none of us at Starting Line are trained macroeconomists, although Haley and Scott both get honorable mentions for their Bachelors Degrees in Finance! 

Nevertheless, we are in the business of observing the present and there are certain facts worth paying attention to. From Kyle Bass, CIO of Hayman Capital Management on CNN’s First Move with Julia Chatterly: 

>When you look at the way that inflation’s calculated, specifically, 40% or so of the inflation calculation is focused on US rents, and they call it owner’s equivalent – and housing – but as we just saw in the Case-Schiller print, you saw housing prices year over year, nationwide, were up 10%, and yet the housing component of inflation is way down, holding inflation down. And you have to scratch you head and say ‘what’s going on?’ 

>And what’s really going on is the fact in the mismanaged states in the US, ie call it New York and California, you’re seeing rents collapse, and the price at which people are willing to rent things on the coasts is affecting the way that inflation’s calculated. For those of us in the rest of the United States, we’re seeing already substantial inflation. Look at copper – copper’s doubled last year. Lumber prices, doubling. The price to build things is doubling year over year. We’re not talking about a 1% decline in inflation or a flat number, we’re talking about a doubling in many areas of your life. So, I think inflation’s already here and everybody knows it…and people need to be thinking longer term about what they want to own. 

I have believed for some time now that the cryptocurrency markets – because of their general insularity from regulatory input – are more reflective of fiat currency strengths and inflation than any centralized source. So it might not be surprising then that myself – as well as many other cryptocurrency enthusiasts – lend our digitized dollars (USDT) through collateralized, peer to peer platforms, which currently offer 35-50% annualized interest:
 
If forced, I would guess that’s likely a closer range to true inflation than 2-3%. But, as noted, none of us are trained macroeconomists. Therefore, we have – and will continue – to study the history of the great inflation between 1965-1983, its causes, nuaces, and, most importantly, the behavioral changes prompted by consumer reactions to extreme inflation, that will hopefully prompt multiple investment opportunities if those forces do materialize.

## Q2 2019

**THE FOUR MINUTE MILE**

One of my favorite lessons in psychology comes from the well known story of Roger Bannister’s four minute mile. A brief recap for the uninitiated – in the world of competitive running, no athlete was able to run a mile in under four minutes for the approximately two millenia of recorded history. Until one day, in 1954, a doctoral student in the UK did. And within two years, after word of his feat proliferated, ten other runners had matched or beaten his time. In the 50 years since, thousands have beaten the four minute mile.

From famed behaviorist Malcom Gladwell –

>"The weird thing in running is how people keep running faster and faster. Take the great example of the four-minute mile. One guy breaks it, then all of a sudden everyone breaks it. And they break it in such a short period of time that it can’t be because they were training harder. It’s purely that it was a psychological barrier and someone had to show them that they could do it. It’s the same thing if you’re a runner and you’re around older runners, you just get the sense of what’s possible. You have no clue, if you’re by yourself, how fast you can run. You have no sense of what your limits are.”

I often think of this incongruity in the frame of startups, market sizing and value creation. For example, in the early 2010’s vertical e-commerce was written off as dead. The implosions of Gilt Group, Fab.com, Wayfair’s 50% decline from its IPO, and Zulily’s 65%+ decline in the public markets off its IPO pop, cultivated the narrative that traditional retail had bottomed, appropriately reversed course, and that niche e-commerce (minus Amazon and eBay) would always be too subscale to matter to investors.

Then, over the following five years, while most of the technology market was ignoring Wayfair (because of its origins in flash sales and its niche vertical focus) it quietly grew into a $15B online retailer:
  

Wayfair’s standing – as a niche commerce company valued in excess of $10B – broke the bias against niche commerce and opened the door for additional fast scaling e-commerce companies to cross the same threshold.

Cue Chewy.com, the internet’s largest retailer of pet food and supplies, which went public this month ($14B):

     
 
If you interrogate any investor at a top 20 SF based venture firm (and I would know, I’ve asked a dozen or so) about direct to consumer startups, you’ll hear a common refrain: that the market is over-funded and that exits aren’t meaningfully large enough to modern fund sizes, with the recent acquisitions all topping out in the $1B range. Those recent outcomes in the $1B range would be Dollar Shave Club ($1B), Harry’s ($1.3B), and the soon to IPO Warby Parker (expected to be in the $2B range.) So that’s the narrative: how can you justifiably back a Series B company at a $200M valuation if $1B in terminal value is your likely ceiling? And I would tend to agree with that sentiment that most firms shouldn’t underwrite to a 5x.

Unless, of course, the narrative changes.

And lo and behold, there’s a catalyst on the horizon: Smile Direct Club. The company, which competes directly with Invisalign (NASDAQ: ALGN), was founded in 2014 and has quickly grown to $1B in expected 2019 revenues by undercutting the incumbents by 50%, cutting out the need for inconvenient trips to the dentist office, and leveraging telehealth for fittings. They’re also likely to IPO later this year, at an expected valuation of $6-10B.

What’s often left unreported about this story is that the market for braces in the US isn’t particularly massive. Ibisworld, a leading market research firm, pegged the US market size at $5.6B in 2018. A number which is pretty comparable (if not smaller) to many of the Direct-to-consumer categories being deemed “immaterial” by many VCs. Align Technologies, parent of Invisalign, for whatever it’s worth, actually trades at a premium to SDC’s expected pricing – 12x trailing revenues – and a $24B market cap at the time of this letter.

It’s a fair critique to suggest that most categories are not conducive to startups gaining close to 10% market share in five years. But there are pros and cons to every category – and most also don’t have a 30% share behemoth to wage war against.

The point is this – whether SDC goes public at a $6B valuation, an $8B valuation or a $12B valuation, it will wholly invalidate the narrative that D2C products simply can’t become all that large. It may encourage investors to re-focus on higher CAGR categories (which we do), categories with strong behavioral tailwinds (which we do), and products that are both cheaper and better (which we do) – all good things from my perspective. But our hope is that the moving of the goalposts on outcome sizes will help to reframe the underlying value of many companies both in our portfolio, and in others’, that are growing at outsized rates.

**FEAR AND GREED**

The venture capital market is the single most competitive I have experienced it in my nearly eight years in the industry. Full stop.

That is rational to me given that the stakes are higher, the outcomes are larger, and the velocity of value creation is faster than at any point in the past two decades. 
According to my friend Samir Kaji, Managing Director of First Republic Bank, approximately 1,000 new venture capital funds have sprung up in the past several years, the vast majority focused on the seed stage. Again, this is a rational consequence: widescale and fast value creation will of course attract many new participants looking to extract that value.

The question, of course, is what to do about it.

It probably won’t surprise anyone that I’m a fan and admirer of Howard Marks – whose copious writings over the years often provide historical precedent and insights into every financial situation imaginable across the pendulum of cyclicality.

In his latest book, Mastering the Market Cycle, he opines on the following effects which he claims typically occur when “euphoria, optimism and greed rise:”

>*	“Since they feel better about the environment and are more optimistic about likely outcomes, they reduce the amount of caution they bring to the investing process.”
>*	“Since they no longer consider investing to be risky, they don’t see the need for painstaking analysis.”
>*	“They tend of make assumptions that are more generous, and they replace skepticism with credulousness.”
>*	“They’re willing to make do with a reduced margin of safety.”
>*	“Viewing risk as less worrisome, they no longer demand risk premiums as cushy as in the past.”
>*	“They behave less as sticklers, since they’re more attracted to the returns on risky investments and less leery of the risk they involve. 

>It is for these reasons that the shakiest financings are completed in the most buoyant economies and financial markets. Good times cause people to become more optimistic, jettison their caution, and settle for skimpy risk premiums on risky investments. Further, since they are less pessimistic and less alarmed, they tend to lose interest in the safer end of the risk/return continuum. This combination of elements makes the prices of risky assets rise relative to safer ones.” (p. 111).

There is a credible claim to be made that the current startup financing environment meets each of these euphoric qualifications. Certainly due diligence on companies is at the lowest levels I have ever seen. Speed to financing (irrespective of diligence) is at the fastest levels I have ever seen. And it sure seems that growth stage investors are valuing startups with a nearly blind eye towards their underlying risks.

That said, there’s also an argument that in venture, biasing towards the “safer end of the risk/return continuum,” typically leads to under-performance anyways (venture is a power law driven business after all.) In his most recent memo, “This Time It’s Different,” he does add the following about the venture industry: “In investing, however, the truth usually lies somewhere between the extremes of infinite value and worthlessness. [Tech] investor sentiment seems to be closer to the positive end of the pendulum’s arc these days, but it’s unlikely to stay there in perpetuity.”

Either way, Mark’s framework makes the following point clear: that the early stage venture environment is enamored with risk and, it seems, willing to pay premiums decoupled from reason. Accepting that we at Starting Line are not smart enough to predict tops and bottoms, the question then becomes how to play the “game on the field,” to use Gurley’s parlance. 

We’d like to suggest the following structure which we arrived at through a mix of organic experimentation and some hypothesization that is thus far working for us, but may not be appropriate for others:

*	Prioritize outbound driven pipeline efforts, rather than inbound “referrals,” allowing us to better control the tempo of financings, avoid group-think, or, alternately, avoid adverse selection.
*	Prioritize efforts with startups that are not “in market” fundraising, but where we can build a relationship with management, work with them to craft an accelerated growth plan, thereby better controlling the tempo of the financing and syndicate formation.
*	Diligence management and markets aggressively ahead of initial engagement so that we can execute with high conviction towards founders and products that we feel affinity for. Though we may be forced to sacrifice some diligence on underlying company data in certain situations, we can still maintain “smart money” principles on overall investment.
*	In competitive situations, prioritize speed but not pricing, aiming to be the first bid in a process.  By making a strong first impression with our conviction and speed, we accordingly increase deal related optionality and force management teams to react to our moves.
*	Execute a tight-aggressive approach; rather than spraying term sheets across the market and hoping to win a small percentage, instead choosing which processes we are deeply convicted on and aggressively selling our networks to maintain a high win percentage. 

With this framework, we are aiming to mitigate the effects of the current capital environment as much as possible. If we can play a differentiated game than the rest of the market, we will be able to transform a highly competitive market into a more greenfield one. As with any operating manual, it is a work in progress, subject to market changes, but we do hope it sheds some light on how we’re thinking about investing and being responsible, mature, stewards of your capital.


## EOY 2018

**ANNUAL SCORECARD**

We believe it’s appropriate to evaluate the success of Starting Line across the following dimensions:

1.	Financial performance
2.	Deals won %
3.	Deal creativity
4.	Fund strategy
5.	Team building

**PERFORMANCE**

There’s only one true arbiter of truth in investing and that is financial return. Each of you has real-time access to the following Schedule of Investments dashboard through your Carta portal, but here is the current fund accounting as of this letter’s circulation, [redacted]:

Overall, fund performance is ahead of where we expected to be nine months into a brand new early stage fund. Early outperformance has been driven solely by our $1m seed bet into Cameo, and we are hopeful to see additional paper (unrealized) gains over the coming 6-12 months in that position given the stream of inbound interest in their business.

[redacted] have also been fielding inbound interest, with [redacted] planning to go back to mark in mid-Q2. We had not modeled out any gains (realized or unrealized) this early in our fund cycle, but feel blessed to have early momentum. 

**DEALS WON %**

The single most important predictor of financial returns in venture capital is winning competitive deals. As Jeremy Liew, General Partner at Lightspeed notes in Three Pieces of Advice to New Investors: “success in venture is ultimately about convincing founders of great companies to select you as their lead. Easier said than done. Unfortunately, I know of no secret recipe that infallibly works to win those competitive deals.”

Why does being a lead investor matter? Interestingly, it actually may not matter a lot for smaller funds that are only looking to slide non-threatening $100-250k checks alongside existing syndicates. But at Starting Line, and other firms that look to gain $1M+ allocations in early stage financing rounds, being the lead investor is the only repeatable method for ensuring access to these larger allocations (and valuable pro-rata allocations down the line).

In our first four core deals, we won 75%* of the processes we sought. The asterisk reflects that even in one of the processes we technically lost, Starting Line still was offered one of the largest allocations of the entire syndicate, thus not a total loss.

[redacted]

**DEAL CREATIVITY**

Having invested out of the Midwest ecosystem for over 7 years now, I am convinced that lack of deal creativity is a material driver of fund underperformance in the region. When I spend time in the Bay area, I am always surprised by the number of times I hear my friends mention offhand to a Company co-founder, “if you’re ever looking to sell some of your shares, we’d love to buy them.” We want Starting Line to be known amongst its LPs as having a relentless urgency of finding ways into the best deals – even if those means are non-traditional. 

That said, being only nine months in to a new fund, it feels somewhat inappropriate to be running complex secondary transactions. Nevertheless, we feel emboldened through the following two data points:

1.	As mentioned above, Made In Cookware had a flush balance sheet and was not looking to raise capital. Through a combination of syndicate development (sourcing a co-lead and local board member for them), a barrage of references and calls from both entrepreneurs and LPs, we were able to manufacture a financing that would otherwise not have been available. I love these scenarios as this result is pure alpha that is not available to more traditionally minded firms.

Here’s an example of some of the work we put together for them while positioning to lead their round:

 
 

2.	We sourced our first deal ever through Twitter. An entrepreneur we had been tracking, announced her new Company on Twitter. Through the following prompt, we were able to connect that same way and get an investment closed in under 30 days. Although this is not pure alpha creation, it is a deal outside our existing network that would otherwise not have been in play.

 

**FUND STRATEGY**

Based on our experiences in venture, and feedback from Starting Line’s Advisory Board we are intentional in deploying our fund along a barbell strategy:
 
I think we scored a solid B+ in executing along this strategy in our first 9 months. For example, Cameo had already recorded multiple strong revenue months when we issued our term sheet. Made In Cookware is a later stage deal than we had expected to fund, and booked nearly [redacted] in revenue this past November. Unchained Capital had originated almost $10M in loan volume when we invested. 

A barbell strategy makes sense because it allows a new fund to (hopefully) record some early mark-ups, but, more importantly (and also, hopefully), generate some early liquidity on the back-end in years 4-7 for LPs, instead of years 7-10.

In each of these cases, we earned 5-9% ownership stakes for our checks given the existing level of product/market fit and progress. Our hope is that by moving down the stack by 6-9 months of a Company’s lifecycle, similar check sizes will earn us 8-15% ownership in a Company. We aim to finish the final few investments of the Fund, with later stage (relative, of course) bets that ideally prevent the clock from pushing out past 10-12 years. Though, of course, these durations are impossible to predict.

**TEAM BUILDING**

I am grateful to have met Ade, now a Venture Partner at Starting Line, and appreciate both his investment in the fund and his time commitment thus far. His involvement to date has been invaluable, and I have seen firsthand the powerful impression he makes on entrepreneurs – both prospective and in the portfolio.

Over the past few months, I met with several dozen potential candidates to join the fund – ranging from entry level analyst to equal partners. None, to date, have met the qualifications necessary. Those qualifications include:

-	A deep rolodex of investors at premier Venture Capital firms in San Francisco and New York.
-	A passion for hunting down and chasing deals & a thirst for winning over elusive entrepreneurs.
-	Ingenuity and creativity that allows them to operate smarter than the herd.
-	A strong appeal towards diverse and underserved entrepreneurs.

Ade, having previously raised money from several of the world’s top investors, including Chris Sacca at Lowercase, Steve Anderson at Baseline, Josh Felser at Freestyle and more, met these qualifications. But that is exceedingly rare to find in the Midwest. 

I hope to have positive progress in this area in 2019.

**SUMMARY**

If forced to provide a scorecard, I would rank Starting Line’s key metrics roughly as follows:

-	Performance: A-
-	Deals Won %: B+
-	Deal Creativity: B
-	Fund Strategy: B+
-	Team Building: C+

If there are any other operating metrics you would like to see, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. For reference, although we record all dealflow in Pipedrive CRM, we do not plan to report on volume of “deals seen,” as we believe it to be mostly a vanity metric that can be expanded at will to impress LPs and with disregard for underlying company quality. 

**KRAFT HEINZ AND WHY THE D2C REVOLUTION MAY BE BIGGER THAN YOU THINK**

Late last week, Kraft-Heinz, one of the largest global food conglomerates reported disappointing earnings, admitted to an SEC investigation, and wrote down the value of a couple of its iconic brands. The market responded by dumping their stock 30% – the single largest daily drop in its history – wiping out ~$15B of market value. Their (rather depressing) day looked something like this:
 
On the surface, it’s yet another data point in the continuing narrative that dinosaur retail brands are going extinct at the hands of millennials and their changing preferences. And I would largely agree with that take. But I wanted to take a few words to dig a bit deeper and hopefully provide some valuable clues to better understand how the value shift – specifically towards direct to consumer brands – is playing out, where it will accelerate, and what it’s actually worth.
Good Luck Good Will Hunting

There’s a curious accounting mechanism on every corporate balance sheet in this country that no one really loses much sleep over, but perhaps they should. It’s called “Goodwill,” and it basically means what its name suggests – a kind or considerate gesture above and beyond any realistic expectation or value. Goodwill and its sister, “Intangible Asset,” exist in order to ensure the appropriate balance of, well, the balance sheet.

The basics are that every balance sheet must adhere to the following accounting formula: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Meaning that if you have $100 in your company bank account and no other assets, you are functionally required to have either $100 in some form of accounts payable, or else $100 worth of equity, from say a fundraise.

But a funny thing often happens on the way to the forum. Let’s say you’re a large multi-national conglomerate and you want to make an acquisition. So you find a super sexy, fast growing company you want to purchase and you transfer your hard earned cash for it. Now it may not have much in the way of earnings, but, as we mentioned, it sure is sexy and therefore has a really cool brand. And assuming you’ve paid cash for this company, your liabilities haven’t changed one bit, but your cash position is now short $1B, so you need to find another line item to increase in order to balance out that formula of Assets = Liabilities + Equity.

Enter Goodwill. Or intangibles. (There is a difference but we’re trying to keep this simple.) You mark down your cash position $1B, but you mark up Goodwill by $1B and voila, all is equal. (This is overly simplistic…most companies do have some assets, so the “goodwill” is technically the premium over their book value. The official formula is Goodwill = Purchase Price – (Assets + Liabilities.))

But after a few decades in business and a few dozen acquisitions, it begins to become a massive cluster of, well, something. Here is Kraft-Heinz’s most recent balance sheet:

 


While this is pretty typical, it’s also somewhat astounding if you take a step back and actually think about what’s going on here. Of Kraft-Heinz’s approximately $100B in gross asset value, only 1% is in cash, and 3% in some form of inventory. Instead, nearly 85% of their assets are tied up broadly in Goodwill or Intangibles.

What does this even mean? Well, you’re right to ask. It means that 85% of Kraft Heinz’s assets are reflected in their trademarks and brands. Actually, not even. These line items can mean even more than that: they can refer to customer lists, or they can refer to historically good customer service, or they can even refer to good Company culture. But let’s keep it simple: $85B in brands and trademarks. Which means: building better brands, for example launching a hot dog that consumers love more than Oscar-Meyer, a cheese better than Kraft, or a coffee better than Maxwell House unlocks $85B of asset value. (Of course, it’s not quite that easy, but you see where we’re going here.)

On Brands and Final Stands

So it turns out that “brands,” however you want to define them are worth quite a bit. At least at Kraft-Heinz. What about some other iconic American conglomerates? Well, Unilever has $28B of brand intangibles, GE has $84B, Proctor and Gamble has $80B, Newell has about $10B, and the list goes on and on and on. Even my beloved Hershey’s has $1B in intangibles (but let’s be real folks, that one is probably pretty safe.)

So in aggregate, today’s retailers and CPG conglomerates are carrying many trillions of dollars of “brand” asset values on their balance sheets. Interesting. But these are audited public filings so those valuations are all probably legitimate and valid, right? Wink, wink.

No, of course not. Although it’s true that external auditors require Goodwill to be evaluated on a regular basis, companies are pretty creative at “aiding” the analysis and generally try to delay write downs as long as they can without doing something wrong. Truth is, can anyone reasonably assess the difference between a $9 billion brand versus an $11 billion brand? As a friend and public company CFO noted to me when I asked him about this issue: “It’s human nature that you don’t want to admit something until the evidence is overwhelming.” Yup.

So what does this all have to with direct to consumer startups and the dizzying volume of emerging millennial brands? Well, I suspect the narrative – as recently expressed by Kraft Heinz – suggests that many of these new high growth brands are deeply, viciously, undervalued.

This is a contrarian view. When Allbirds, a 2.5 year old shoe company, recently raised financing at a nearly $1.5 billion valuation, a lot of eyebrows were raised. When Rothy’s another nascent shoe brand raised financing at a valuation above $1 billion, there were more eyebrows. When an ostensibly absurd “box of stuff” startup, FabFitFun raised $80M last month (also at a $1b valuation), I heard laughter. It is easy to eye roll. But it might overlook fundamental value creation.

If you’ve made it this far, and you’re an investor in some capacity, you might ask: “but aren’t companies valued by their earnings, not their intangible brand equity?” And this is true. Pick your variable – sales, EBITDA, etc – companies trade alongside benchmarks for these variables.

But how do you value a company growing 200-300% a year in a category where the incumbents are growing 2% annually? It’s functionally impossible. So typically they trade (are valued) at a material premium to the “market,” even though in this case the market isn’t even really a representative comp.

However, consider for a moment my CFO friend’s observation: “It’s human nature that you don’t want to admit something until the evidence is overwhelming.” Kraft may be only the first rock, but an avalanche is coming. So how do you value a company that is both growing 200% a year, and serves as a substitute for years of deferred write-downs that conglomerate X is carrying, but hasn’t yet admitted.

That company would trade at a material premium to the material premium.

We’ve seen this already begun to play out in the organic food industry – with Danone’s 2016 purchase of Whitewave at a 21x forward multiple (nearly 50% premium to an already over-heated M&A market) or Kellogg’s acquisition of RxBar at more than 6x sales (a more than 300% premium to the Company’s own multiple). But food is arguably the most mature of all innovation industries; consumers’ self-reported behavioral change has now been widely accepted for more than a decade. Not so much in other categories.

It’s an interesting time for the direct to consumer market. There’s been a lot of funding, but very few exits to date, and many investors I’ve spoken to are privately a bit nervous: what if all these brands aren’t worth as much we’ve thought? But – what if on the contrary, they’re actually worth a whole lot more? Which could very well be the case if trillions of dollars of corporate asset values are nothing more than deferred write-downs.

If, as I suspect, Kraft’s move forces discussions in many CFO suites to admit reality, it could catalyze an accelerated turnover of brands and an M&A boom in a variety of industries. And it’s likely we’ll start to know in as little as 2-3 years.

At my new fund, Starting Line, we are aggressively investing into these emerging brands, even in categories that may seem small, and are always open to connect.

## Q3 2018

**ON SHADOW MARKETS**

Consensus opinion has long suggested that the best investments are made by betting into large addressable markets; as the logic goes, they offer known and provable demand, and, as the back of the envelope math goes, even capturing a tiny 1% of a $100 billion market yields the ever illusive billion dollar company. 

Except that the aforementioned consensus is at best imprecise, and at worst, simply wrong.

Good companies are built into large markets. Extraordinary companies are built into markets that don’t yet exist. But could. And should.

“Could” and “should” is where we spend the majority of our time discovering and identifying opportunities for Starting Line. I’m deeply proud that many of our early investments had functionally no addressable market to speak of – as of a year ago (a) the market for video shout-outs didn’t exist for Cameo (b) the market for cryptocurrency collateralized loans didn’t exist for Unchained (c) [redacted], and the list goes on. In the past six months, we’ve seen the market for personalized video messages from celebrities grow substantially; it’s my hope that markets for our other early investments similarly materialize.

Smart money appears to share conviction that this is not a delusional approach. In a 2015 interview as part of [Linkedin’s Speaker Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3mBM4FelZs), Benchmark Capital General Partner Matt Cohler noted the following:

>“What I don’t look for in investments: a lot of entrepreneurs talk about ‘big markets,’ and if anything, I think a big market is a bit of a red flag. Because if something is really a big market, it’s probably going to be pretty hard for you, this underfunded startup, to get into any sort of position of strength in that market. You’re going to be one of a bunch of fish swimming in this giant ocean and there’s probably a bunch of sharks and boats there too and it’s going to be very hard to thrive. 

>I actually much prefer things that look like small markets, but that you can look at and say, imagine what the intersection of this entrepreneur and this product and this model, imagine what it could do to change and reshape this market. A textbook case from the generation we’re in is Uber where early on a lot of people looked at Uber and said: well, how big can that really be? Taxis and limos? That’s nice.

>Uber has radically changed and reshaped the way people think about transportation along with a lot of other things. So that’s the type of opportunity where you can imagine a future where you’ve grown and changed and reshaped the market, that’s far more exciting to me by far than a big market.”

Danny Rimer, General Partner of Index Ventures, whose firm over the past few years has grown from a relatively obscure European fund into a must-visit SF early stage firm (Dropbox, Slack, Bird, Farfetch, Discord), shares this belief around small or non-existent markets. From a [recent, 2018 interview:](http://www.thetwentyminutevc.com/dannyrimer/)

>“As much as Amazon is well positioned on the mainstream, when it comes to niches, we think that Amazon is not particularly well positioned to go after it. Part of it is because you’ve seen the service and what they’re trying to do and they’re really just trying to capture the main populace that is going to be online with more generic product that you need on a day to day basis. When it comes to areas of passion and cult following, that’s not something that Amazon focuses on.

>I think that if there’s something we’ve gotten wrong repeatedly, it’s to underestimate the sizing of specific niches. What we tend to forget is that when you’re connecting most of the world’s population, there are going to be niches that just explode in size as a result of having everyone that’s interested in that particular area connected. And so if we’d really thought about market sizes, we probably wouldn’t have done some of the best investments we’ve ever done.

>I’ll never forget investing in Etsy and folks saying that’s crazy – they’re already 250,000 merchants online, all these arts and craft stores, how many more can there be? Well, I think we’re at 3 million and counting. So Etsy’s the perfect example of how niches can explode into much larger opportunities when you connect them online.”

Matt and Danny are actually making two nuanced points across a similar theme; Matt, that underdeveloped (and seemingly small) markets can quickly materialize when matched with the right product/model, and Danny, that consumer niches which instinctively seem “non venture scale,” can frequently become venture scale as they proliferate. But the takeaway from both is similar: make contrarian bets on the categories that others deem to be uninteresting. 

This aligns with a statement I recently heard from Benchmark Capital General Partner Bill Gurley: “false negative is where all the pain is in this industry.” Specifically, that passing on a deal that ultimately returns 100x, due to lack of imagination, is the cardinal sin of any fund manager. Gurley considers himself a student of Matt Ridley, author of The Rational Optimist, forcing himself to always ask: what could go right?

I can’t promise that we will always get it right at Starting Line. But I can promise that we will always ask ourselves that same question: what could go right?

**THE HYBRID FUND OF THE FUTURE**

A mere seven months ago, I tweeted the following:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9RvUmdx.png" width=400>

In retrospect, I was embarrassingly wrong. 

If you’re curious, here’s what Buffet had to say in the attached video: 

>“I would say there’s no one here that can understand some new internet company. I said at the annual meeting this year that if I were teaching at business school, on the final exam I would pass out the information on an internet company and ask each student to value it…and anyone that gave me an answer, I’d flunk. 

>I don’t know how to do it…but people do it every day. It’s more exciting. If you look at it like going out to the races that’s one thing, but if you’re investing – investing is putting out money to be sure of getting more money back later at an appropriate rate. And to do that, you need to understand what you’re doing it in, you need to understand the business. And you can understand some businesses, but not all of them.”

Buffet is one of my heroes – brilliant, articulate, passionate, but more importantly: consistent, charitable and high integrity. And if someone is your hero, you should take the time to truly internalize their message. In retrospect, Buffet’s message wasn’t that internet companies were scams, it was that any notion of “valuation” had become decoupled from any observable foundation.

My reaction, back in May, was wrong in that it unintentionally ascribed to the “new paradigm” narrative that I have tried to dispel, including in last quarter’s update. Let’s be clear – crypto is a new asset class. It trades on different exchanges from other assets and its [returns are materially uncorrelated](https://coinmetrics.io/correlations/#assets=btc-s&p,btc-gld) from equities such as the S&P 500 or even safe haven Store-of-Values such as gold. But, importantly, that doesn’t mean it’s a “different art.” 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HMRAijo.png" width=400> 

Investing is about [entry points and exit points](https://medium.com/first-round-insiders/crystal-balls-vs-calculators-7373c0e09c93), and no difference in “asset class” can substitute for that reality. Entry/exit requires an acute perspective on expected value – upside versus downside – which is a calculus that admittedly got entirely lost during the crypto mania of 2017. Ethereum, the largest smart contracts platform (a global, decentralized database) traded up, touching a $150B market cap, or, for comparison’s sake, roughly the same valuation of the most storied and tested database companies in the world, Oracle and IBM.

Crypto is exciting, but I concede that in spite of some [valiant efforts](https://medium.com/cryptolab/https-medium-com-kalichkin-rethinking-nvt-ratio-2cf810df0ab0), no one really has a clue how to value it. At the same time, it would also be naïve to assume that these platforms do not have any inherent value. Most investors agree that the absolute smartest engineers in the world have and continue to gravitate towards blockchain focused products. Tens of millions of people now own cryptocurrencies and these platforms represent the largest, organically scaled peer-to-peer networks in the history of…humanity? To suggest, as Nouriel Roubini does that these large social movements are the [“mother of all scams”](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/roubini-bitcoin-is-mother-of-all-scams.html) and represent no underlying value is patently absurd.

Which seemingly leaves us at an impasse: these new assets ostensibly have value, but it’s functionally impossible to scientifically assess how much. 

It’s a good thing there’s a proven solution for this type of uncertainty: early stage venture capital. 

Traditional early stage venture capital is predicated on a simple proposition: find asymmetrical risk and reward opportunities. These most commonly materialize as risking one times your money for the opportunity to return 25 times that check. The investments Starting Line typically makes, often at $4/6/8/10 million valuations fit this mold. In the vast majority of cases, these businesses are not literally worth their early stage valuations at the time of funding. But those valuations are still a workable function of the opportunity to return many times principal.

As technology proliferates all aspects of the emerging economy, whether that is consumer packaged goods, brick & mortar retail, healthcare, or even crypto, there are an increasing number of asymmetric risk/reward opportunities that may well not look like traditional software bets. I am a strong proponent that if a company’s P&L and velocity of growth appear venture scale (read: high multiple), and my job is to find asymmetric upside opportunities, I should make that investment irrespective of whether the opportunity is in software, CPG or crypto.

Over the past 12 months, valuations in the crypto sector have declined precipitously, with every single major cryptocurrency down [80-99% from their all time highs](https://messari.io/onchainfx/). A few, although by no means all, can credibly fit into this asymmetric framework. For example, a digital currency with a large target market, hundreds of thousands of holders, that has continued to hit product timelines, but which trades at market capitalizations under $10M, very likely has asymmetric upside.

It’s a long way of saying that it’s unclear to me that venture capital funds will continue to generate outsized returns by focusing exclusively on one niche of the broader technology ecosystem. I suspect the best firms will begin to evolve (many, such as a16z, have already begun evolving) to more broadly invest in asymmetric innovation, irrespective of its underlying category. 

## Q2 2018

**ON MARKET DISLOCATIONS AND GENERATIONAL ANAMOLIES**

Several weeks ago while watching a Netflix documentary with my wife, I began thinking about Netflix’s extraordinary growth over the past decade, and, in particular, a widely circulated short thesis authored by famed short seller Whitney Tilson in 2010. In that letter, Tilson noted the business was built on unsustainable content licensures that would never be repeated and would kill their margins:

>“The bulk of Netflix’s current movie content is from two deals: one struck in 2008 with Starz and one this August with Epix, which is owned by three studios, Paramount Pictures, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

>The first major deal, signed in October 2008, was with Starz, giving Netflix access to approximately 2,500 Disney and Sony movies for a mere $25-$30 million annually, a small fraction of what Starz originally paid the studios and what Starz charges TV operators. Under the current contract, Netflix is paying Starz less than 15 cents per subscriber per month for its content vs. the $2-$4 per subscriber per month that TV operators typically pay Starz.

>We assume that Starz didn’t see Netflix as a potential competitor at the time – Netflix was much smaller and did very little streaming – and viewed the $25-$30million as found money. Also, Starz was taking advantage of a loophole in its contract with Disney and Sony, neither of which anticipated that Starz would re-license their content. All of these factors that led to Netflix getting a sweetheart deal are now gone – Starz, Disney and Sony have woken up to the value of their content and the threat that Netflix poses – so Netflix will either have to pay up or lose the Starz content when the contract expires in 10 months.”

In fact, Tilson was right; Netflix paid up for multiple content deals over the following 12 months and is now the largest content producer in the world. Yet, the stock has appreciated nearly 2000% since then.

What Tilson failed to appreciate at the time (he did cover his short nine months later) was that great businesses are often built on generational anomalies. Extraordinary entrepreneurs hone in on market dislocations – often temporary due to changing macro factors – and exploit these dislocations for as long as they persist. Even as those macro factors change, businesses that were able to leverage dislocations to provide a fundamentally new and differentiated experience often continue to sustain. Those dislocations enabled them to aggregate a large amount of customers, data, relationships, and other moats that no one else had.

It reminds me of my personal investment in Flyhomes (made prior to launching Starting Line Fund I), one of the fastest growing real estate brokerages in the country, which recently closed a $17m Series A led by Andreessen-Horowitz. The founders saw their friends continually losing home bids to all cash, no contingency offers in hot real estate markets from foreign investors or HNWIs. They built a product to combat that pain point, which functionally converts any home bid into an all cash, no contingency offer so that middle class prospective buyers are able to compete in the Country’s hottest real estate markets.

When they were raising their seed round, the most common questions they received from seed investors were: isn’t this a product that only works during real estate booms? What on earth do you do when the market turns, foreign money dries up, and no one needs your product anymore? Why would customers come to you then? In that state, wouldn’t you have to compete on the same playing field as every other brokerage in the country?

What Flyhomes understood was that they didn’t need a decades long bull market to build a big business. They needed 24 months, maybe 36 months. Because they are able to provide customers with a radically different, 10x better experience that solved such a major pain point, they just needed some time – though by no means forever – to aggregate thousands of 5-star reviews, thousands of happy customers, and strong word of mouth referrals. What that business would look like in a different macro environment is unclear – but it would likely have a significant edge as it sought to reinvent itself: a high NPS brand, large amount of data, and a broad base of customers.

Many of today’s unicorns share a common generational anomaly at their core: a historically low cost of borrowing money. Many Fintech businesses such as Opendoor, Avant, SoFi, Even, Borro and more have been able to leverage their scale to borrow large credit facilities, arbitraging it against an end consumer’s (or business’) effective rate, which they still find competitive.

Interestingly, not all generational anomalies produce long lasting value. The “flash sales” boom, defined by largely defunct poster children Fab.com, Gilt Group and One Kings Lane was an outgrowth of the 2007-2009 great recession. As consumers pulled back discretionary spending during the recession, retailers and manufacturers nationwide found themselves sitting on large inventories of product they were unable to sell, subsequently liquidating them to flash sales providers who in turn flipped them at 50-70% retail discounts to consumers, right as the economy began to rebound. These businesses grew at unprecedented rates over a 2-3 year period and quickly sold through many years worth of inventory backlogs. 

But as the economic environment continued to improve into the 2010s, the flash sales providers had a fundamental problem: merchandising. They could still procure product – just not good product. It turned out that although they had aggregated large customer bases, their customers associated them with deals on name brands, not deals in general or even more broadly, shopping. These businesses did ultimately maintain some terminal value – just not much; Gilt Groupe was acquired by Hudson’s Bay for $250M, One King’s Lane for $12M by Bed Bath & Beyond, while Fab.com was a zero.

Let’s be clear: I do not consider myself prescient enough to spot these market dislocations and generational anomalies myself. Ultimately, Starting Line’s success is dependent on obsessive entrepreneurs to observe these changes and find the data to support their intuitions. I authored this section to more clearly define for each of you the types of qualities the fund looks for in entrepreneurs and the types of market dynamics that are primed for investment. 

**ON CRYPTO AND THE FUTURE OF DECENTRALIZATION**

Bitcoin may have retreated from its extraordinary peak of $19,800, but its presence has only increased in the public discourse. Anecdotally, it is the number one question I receive from both current and prospective investors.

The fund’s outlook on cryptocurrency remains fairly straightforward:

Cryptocurrencies, in spite of media hype to the contrary, are software/code at their core and therefore, where applicable, should fall within the purview of a traditional venture capital fund.

Just as the internet re-empowered consumers by removing information asymmetries, cryptocurrencies will re-empower consumers in areas where they are subject to asymmetries of power/regulation by decentralizing those agencies. 

Two concrete examples are as follows: by removing the opacity of prices, quality and fragmented markets, the internet enabled businesses such as eBay and Yelp to exist and thrive. Consumers, who had previously been limited to fairly localized information and knowledge, could make decisions around price or quality based on a global, wholly transparent understanding of the market, not a local understanding. This is why, for instance, the baseball cards you likely collected in the 1990s are [worth far less than you’d believed at the time](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2014/12/17/the-baseball-card-bubble); it turns out there was a glut of supply of most cards, but that supply/demand was deeply imbalanced in any given city or card shop. Without a transparent market, most consumers simply relied on the anecdotal prices published by Beckett magazine. Once true market dynamics were revealed, demand could never satiate supply.

In today’s environment, normal consumers and citizens are mere price takers, vis-à-vis financial institutions and governments. Consumers have minimal input on what is considered legal, just, or even the use of their tax dollars. So too they have de minimus control over their relationship with financial institutions: capital requirements, borrowing rates, solvency, risk, etc. Arguably the two largest influences on civilization – money and government – are functional autocracies. Yes, consumers have “choice” – they can vote for their representation and can elect to patronize an alternate bank – but their influence on these systems holistically is rather marginal; they are always dependent on a third party to ultimately enact policy.

Cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications have the potential to be the single largest transformative force of our lifetimes – flattening and decentralizing both money and government – and we are on the precipice of this fundamental change.

All that said, the Fund’s perspective is that these innovations are still software, and, as such, deserve to be evaluated and valued similarly to early stage software businesses. From an investment perspective, the historic crypto bull run of 2017 rendered most of these protocols grossly overvalued by any valuation methodology. In my opinion, the bull run was typified by new entrants and amateur investors arguing that these tokens represented a new paradigm – and as such could not be valued by traditional methods. There is some truth to that: utility tokens and cryptocurrencies do not reflect revenue or earnings. But their value is still dependent on something deeply familiar to early stage technology investors: adoption curves and use cases.

Over the past eight months as the crypto markets have retreated substantially, many projects that I felt had venture scale potential have seen their valuations correct from $100M+ to sub $5M. As such, Starting Line Fund I will consider token opportunities if and where valuation of crypto projects is more on par with those of other early stage digital businesses. In fact, the fund has begun to selectively accumulate a position in a cryptocurrency that reflects the core thesis of the fund: enabling the 99% access to products and privacy typically only available to the elite class. 

Because of the illiquidity and volatility of small cap crypto markets, these positions will never initially represent more than 1% of the fund size.

**CONSOLIDATOR VS CONSOLIDATEE**

Over the past six months, the feedback I have routinely received from the fund’s Advisory Board on deals deep in the pipeline is: how likely is this startup to become a consolidator in their category versus a consolidatee?

What does this really mean? In many venture scale categories from fashion to fintech to food, the ability to raise upstream capital is materially contingent upon whether a company is perceived as likely to be the dominant brand and acquirer in their space – even if the current product or customer base are sub-scale. Why is this important? Because in today’s early stage venture markets, which feature an abundance of capital and relatively low barriers to launch products, every good idea or macro change inspires a dozen startups that are roughly similar. Therefore, each investment must pass an additional hurdle: can this Company achieve enough scale in a short period of time to become a consolidator?

This concept is an intriguing evolution in early stage investing in that it reorients much of what I observed in the mid 2010s. Of course every investor has always desired large outcomes, but during those years, investment mandates tended to be increasingly focused on metrics, cohort analyses, payback periods, etc. It’s not that granular numbers don’t matter – they should and do – but it appears that early stage investing is also reverting back to its fundamentals: does this management team have the acumen and experience to hire 100s of individuals and make multiple acquisitions in a short period of time AND is the category predisposed to enable strong velocity.

I suspect that many investors, myself included, fell into a similar trip during the late 2000s and early 2010s. As Facebook ads and Google SEM enabled startups to experiment with low cost marketing efficacy, businesses began to define themselves by their numbers. (This is in contradistinction to my experience in agency/brand marketing from 2004-2009 where much of my job was about idea generation, project execution and earned media.) For a period of years, startups focused more on their CAC/LTV than they did their concern for whom their customer actually was. This was even codified in Dave McClure’s [Startup Metrics for Pirates](https://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version), which featured the subtitle: “The Only 5 Numbers That Matter.”

As usual, Bill Gurley was both above the crowd and ahead of the crowd. In his seminal 2012 piece [“The Dangerous Seduction of the Lifetime Value Formula,”](http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/09/04/the-dangerous-seduction-of-the-lifetime-value-ltv-formula/) he argued that the obsession around customer acquisition costs and customer life-time value was misplaced, not because they aren’t important numbers – they are – but because the management teams espousing their significance were clueless as to the actual value of their customers. It’s because they viewed these customers as mere metrics that they had lost sight of them being real organic people with differing incentives and actions who do not exist in a vacuum. And dogmatic adherence to these metrics precluded these operators from thinking creatively about their business.

Gurley’s piece was certainly damning of company operators, but it was also true of investors. For a period of time, many investors (myself included) began to ascribe to strong early economics a level of permanence which was unrealistic. In fact, strong early economics actually increased the likelihood that competitors would crowd into the opportunity, inflating costs for all parties and slowing the velocity of growth for any given business. 

It is for these reasons that every investment opportunity must be viewed through the lens of: how likely is it that this company and this management team will become a consolidator in their category. Companies with good metrics but facing headwinds from competitors with bigger balance sheets and better product teams will be unlikely to find the financing to survive. Big outcomes, those that generate a 10x+ return to LPs, are increasingly unlikely to come from “good businesses;” they are far more likely to come from category consolidators.

## Q1 2018

**LIQUIDITY**

There is a fundamental macro shift developing in the venture markets that is worth focusing on: the increasing access to liquidity.  

My entire career in venture capital has been defined by illiquidity. Coming out of the great recession, the IPO markets effectively closed, and the abundance of private market cash (and historically low cost of capital) enabled companies to defer public offerings, and stay private in perpetuity.

During this decade long period since 2008, investors in early stage venture have become habituated to expect 10-15 year cycles of dry illiquidity. And although the 2007 venture vintage – which includes firms such as Uber, Airbnb and Dropbox - is extraordinary on paper – funds raised since 2011 have been dismal in generating realized returns over that period. In spite of the record amount of MicroVC funds being raised ([500 since FY 2012](http://pevcbanker.com/what-you-need-to-know-before-raising-a-micro-vc-fund-today/)), many non-institutional LPs have left the market, waiting to see if they ever get liquid from their venture portfolios and retreating to more comfortable asset classes such as real estate and yield focused alt assets. This feels like a mistake. 

I am seeing macro shifts developing that have the potential for generating record high levels of early liquidity for early stage fund managers. And if I’m right, it’s my sincere hope that I can begin to bend the liquidity curve forward substantially for my investors. I’m not capable of predicting whether this is a paradigm shift or merely temporary, but it very well could be sustained, and I’m excited by it. Here’s why:

RISE OF THE MEGA FUNDS

More than half a dozen bulge bracket venture funds have raised their largest funds since the dot com boom in the past 12 months, and in some cases, their largest funds ever. This includes: Sequoia Capital with $12B, NEA with $3.3B, Lightspeed with $1.8B, General Catalyst with $1.38B, Khosla Ventures with $1.4B, Battery Ventures with $1.25B, not to mention Softbank, investing out of a $100B venture fund, and the list goes on.

These funds are looking to deploy their capital into what is already the most competitive and highly commoditized sector of the venture ecosystem: growth equity. Sure, each fund will sell a worthwhile narrative on their respective advantages, but at the end of the day, much of the valuation bloat in later stage venture is a result of an abundance of commoditized capital 

Raising larger funds forces a subtle shift on fund managers as they work to deploy that capital. Venture managers have historically prioritized their cash-on-cash (gross multiple) returns and consequently graded businesses on their potential to deliver 3-5x+ returns. Mega funds, however, and their associated LP bases, are changing this constitution: prioritizing returns on an IRR basis. To do that effectively, managers must approach investments from a liquidity first perspective.

That is a benefit to early stage managers who traditionally have worked closely with entrepreneurs for a period of 3-5 years to groom them for growth equity, only to re-start the 10-12 year fund clock when these growth equity firms enter the cap table. If, as I suspect, growth equity returns to its roots of guiding for shorter hold, high IRR returns, that will have a positive effect in creating liquidity faster for early stage managers who are dependent on these upstream firms to drive exit windows.

There is a second, more immediate consequence of these mega funds: secondary liquidity. As funds look to put increasing amount of money to work, there is more opportunity than ever before to take money off the table in subsequent financing rounds to enable the growth equity funds to hit their ownership targets and for management to preserve dilution. 

Anecdotally, I’ve been asked half a dozen times in the past quarter regarding three separate investments whether I’d be interested in “taking something off the table.” Very often, early stage funds will prefer to preserve their ownership and elect not to sell when given the opportunity; those who know me are aware I’m highly biased to swing for the fences as well. But this shift in capital concentration is likely to endure for at least the next five years meaning that The Starting Line Fund I should at least have optionality in procuring early liquidity at the Series B and Series C stage of early winners.

SECURITIZED TOKENS

For the past decade, multiple attempts have been made to create liquid trading markets for private company shares. Many may recall version 1.0 of these efforts, which I refer to as the “broker dealer phase.” Firms such as Second Market and Sharespost who facilitated direct share sales from employees/investors to private buyers. Version 2.0 was defined by the likes of Equityzen which pioneered a collateralized forward contract enabling early employees/shareholders to get liquid on 25-50% of their shares, without ever formally transferring the shares - using the remaining shares as a security collateral. Although many expect Carta (formerly eShares) to launch a trading market for secondary share sales of private companies, they have not yet provided guidance; therefore, in spite of the share sale leniencies presented by Regulation D, no real-time liquidity option has developed for shareholders of private market companies. In theory, this has yielded an “illiquidity discount” for shares of private startups.

I hypothesize that securitized tokens will change that in the coming 2-3 years.

Just this month, [Harbor](https://github.com/harborhq/r-token), incubated by David Sacks’ new studio, Craft Ventures, closed $28M from Founders Fund to build a regulatory approved series of smart contracts that can be hosted by exchanges and traded by individuals, without any fear of violating securities law. What this means in practice, is that any private security – issued only to accredited investors – that has not commenced any additional share sale in the prior 90 days, can be freely traded with other accredited individuals. After a full year, those tokens (previously shares) may be sold at will to the general public. Harbor has made a strategic decision to focus its launch on tokenizing real estate interests – which are historically difficult to fractionalize – but it’s only a matter of time until they turn their focus towards private market startups.

In February, [Polymath](https://polymath.network/), backed by a who’s who of advisors from the crypto industry, raised $59M to build a strikingly similar KYC/Reg D compliant blockchain. [Securitize.io](https://www.securitize.io/) offers anyone the opportunity to tokenize a company or fund. More efforts are on the horizon as well.

According to Regulation D, any startup that has not issued a new round of financing in the prior 12 month period is free to tokenize its existing equity – assuming all tangential regulations are met – and begin the free trading of its shares.

Will this become commonplace? I have no idea. Is it good for Boards of Directors to have the option? Absolutely.

Further, there’s one additional nuance. Alongside tokenizing existing equity, there is another tokenization option available to companies: issuance of utility tokens.

A utility token is one whose value is pegged to the future usage of its application or service – and is dislocated from the formal equity valuation of a corporation. Nearly every corporation in the world is capable of issuing some variant of a utility token against the services it offers. Utility tokens currently operate in a very unclear regulatory environment: SEC Director Jay Clayton initially suggested that all utility tokens were unregistered securities, later suggested that some could pass the Howie Test, and just last month the state of Wyoming [formally greenlit utility tokens as a form of property](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwolfson/2018/03/13/u-s-state-of-wyoming-defines-cryptocurrency-utility-tokens-as-new-asset-class/1).

Most blockchain analysts do expect utility tokens to become increasingly commonplace. So the real question is what happens to the value of a company’s equity if it issues a utility token against the forward value of its services? Eden Shochat, General Partner at Aleph notes:

>“If the company depends on value creation via the appreciation of token value and doesn’t get paid for providing a service, it won’t have revenues. If the company sells off [the tokens it owned through the initial issuance] — and thus holds no tokens at all — the company is value-less to you, the founder and your Angel Investor. None of its shareholders own anything.”

You should read his full piece in Forbes, [Attention Founders: That ICO is About to Dilute You Too](https://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2018/02/15/attention-founders-that-ico-is-about-to-dilute-you-too/#5e67950e10b4). It’s an interesting intellectual argument that emphasizes that issuing utility tokens pushes the equity valuation of a business into its tokens. The equity of the parent thereby becomes valueless, save for the value of any tokens it may hold as the issuer. It’s actual quite logical: in traditional markets, the value of equity is merely a derivative of future cash-flows and a company may therefore choose to transition its parent at-will from holding the value of cash flows to the value of utility tokens.

In review, a utility token issuance may be recommended by a Board of Directors at will to re-orient a business’ value away from its cash flows and towards a de facto future market around the value of its services. 

I recognize that was complex. But the whole synopsis is that whether it’s through (a) shorter hold periods at the growth stage (b) traditional secondary sales to growth equity firms (c) tokenization of securities or (d) utility token issuances, multiple macro forces are simultaneously conspiring to re-imagine the expectation of liquidity for early stage startup investors. It’s a trend I am extremely bullish on for The Starting Line and its LPs and I will plan to provide guidance in the future if those tailwinds shift.

**THE HEARTLAND**

I’d be remiss if I didn’t discuss my location in the heart of the Midwest given the recent media focus on the intersection of venture capital and the heartland. It started in March with the following Kevin Roose piece in the New York Times, [Silicon Valley is Over Says Silicon Valley](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/technology/silicon-valley-midwest.html), a summary of a three day bus tour for San Francisco VCs through the Midwest, which noted:

>"But a funny thing happened: By the end of the tour, the coastal elites had caught the heartland bug. Several used Zillow, the real estate app, to gawk at the availability of cheap homes in cities like Detroit and South Bend and fantasize about relocating there. They marveled at how even old-line manufacturing cities now offer a convincing simulacrum of coastal life, complete with artisanal soap stores and farm-to-table restaurants.

>“If it weren’t for my kids, I’d totally move,” said Cyan Banister, a partner at Founders Fund. “This could be a really powerful ecosystem.” 

>These investors aren’t alone. In recent months, a growing number of tech leaders have been flirting with the idea of leaving Silicon Valley. Some cite the exorbitant cost of living in San Francisco and its suburbs, where even a million-dollar salary can feel middle class. Others complain about local criticism of the tech industry and a left-wing echo chamber that stifles opposing views. And yet others feel that better innovation is happening elsewhere."

Many took issue with the piece, painting the bus tour as a voyeuristic retreat for “coastal elites,” who didn’t actually care about the non-coastal cities they were visiting. Dan Primack of Axios noted that any suggestions of a mass exodus from San Francisco was grossly overblown:

>Just two weeks ago I told J that I could see us being happy living in Vermont. Then we drove home from our ski vacation.

>This isn't to say the bus trip, and similar excursions, don't have an impact. They do, in terms of coastal investment dollars flowing into Midwestern startups. And there is data to suggest that California-focused funds no longer generate most of the top returns. But investing ≠ relocating.

Brad Feld at Foundry Group also opined that the narrative had passed the point of sensibility:

>The hyperbolic headlines are once again accompanying the articles about Silicon Valley…Silicon Valley is not over. Over 100 years since its notional inception, it’s a fascinating and amazing ecosystem.

But, he noted, there is a lasting takeaway worth digesting: 

>But it’s also not the only place you can create technology companies. I’m sitting in a hotel in New York and, according to a recent article from Bloomberg, New York Will Never Be Silicon Valley. And It’s Good With That.

>The real story is that you can create startups, and thriving startup communities anywhere. Imagine the NYT article was titled “In a Moment of Introspection, Silicon Valley VCs Realize That There Are Tech Startups Outside of Silicon Valley.” Nah – that wouldn’t get as many clicks.

As with most of life, the truth is somewhere in the middle. I actually participated in the trip, invited by one of the trip’s organizers (and Starting Line fund advisor/investor) , Roy Bahat, founding partner of Bloomberg Beta - and was the only non-coastal VC to travel with the group.

It wasn’t lost on anyone that the vast majority of self-selecting participants were emerging faces in the venture world - the new generation in their partnerships - and more open than their predecessors to sourcing innovation outside of San Francisco. Further, I witnessed no hubris; rather, I experienced firsthand a deep intellectual curiosity and openness to dialogue with real people across the country.

It’s reflective of a larger macro shift at play. When I officially entered the venture world in 2012 and began developing friendships at coastal funds, my efforts in Chicago were considered, at best, “cute.” Sometime in 2016, that began changing. Friends from bulge bracket coastal funds – that had otherwise humored me because they liked me (I presume), but were generally ambivalent about non-SF deals – began proactively reaching out to establish monthly calls or quarterly deep dives, hoping that I would serve as a de facto outsourced deal scout for a wide radius they couldn’t cover. Those conversations have only increased in the past twelve months and several of those firms are now investors directly into Starting Line.

Winning deals in venture is as competitive as its ever been, and the signal to noise ratio is at historic lows. The generational opportunity that I am trying to execute against is becoming a rare trusted signal – even outside of the Valley - in a sea of chaos. Although venture is not a zero sum game, I do believe that material rents will accrue to the firms that can create a moat around brand, trust, and results. I am confident that my early track record in helping to identify and invest in high velocity winners such as Spothero, Hungryroot, and Flyhomes are a strong step in that direction. It’s also the reason I’ve made it a point to dedicate my time towards events and conferences that are non-Midwest focused, and that demonstrate The Starting Line’s thought leadership on a national scale, such as The Marketplace Conference, where I was the only non-San Franciscan to lead a session amongst a sea of 300 attendees:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kqw1HYV.png" width=300> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/l7zv3WL.png" width=300>
    
Operating in the Heartland is a fundamental asset and I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. But location itself is not a sufficient differentiator: it must yield sustained trust. It’s one of the variables I expect each of you to benchmark me and Starting Line against. If we’re failing, it’s imperative that you call me out.

**ON CRYPTO AND GOLD RUSHES**

Only time will tell, but my intuition (supported by the anecdotal) is that an enormous amount of young talent has left the venture capital ecosystem for the greener (maybe) fields of crypto and the emergence of token funds.

I empathize with that seduction: 50% intraday swings and 15x annual moves are exhilarating in a way that the slow and steady grind of venture capital is not. Crypto is truly a digital gold rush, far more democratized than even the dot com era, with barriers to entry as simple as internet access and a credit card. 

Several of my exceptionally talented friends have opted to leave their existing venture firms to pursue the token economy. For some, it is a deeply authentic pursuit and the culmination of years spent obsessing and evangelizing a nascent technology to anyone who would listen. For others, it is unapologetically a money grab. 

Irrespective of the authenticity behind these pursuits, I think there’s a chance that this exodus becomes reflected in the venture asset class in 3-5 years. If, as I suspect, a real number of exceptionally talented, ultra ambitious associates and senior associates, even principals – the future of their firms – are being swept into the crypto wave, it follows that there will be a multi year experience gap and general softness in the traditional venture market down the line.

It’s very unclear to me if this is a near term opportunity that can be capitalized on. At worst, it’s an observation worth tracking. At best, it’s a tailwind reducing some competition in the fight to win the best deals. Time will tell.
